# MY PERSONAL PAGE

## Description:

This is my personal page showcasing some of the work I have accomplished while learning to code.

## Technical Description:
The page was built using only HTML and CSS. All the design and typographic effects were achieved solely through CSS, including the logotype. The objective was to create something captivating using the seemingly mundane Times New Roman font. The homepage format draws loose inspiration from ancient Latin stone writings.
